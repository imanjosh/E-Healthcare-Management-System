# E-Healthcare Management System

**E-Healthcare Management System** is an application that seeks to provide effective management of medical data of 
patients in hospitals and/or clinics. This application will be used by the medical staff of a hospital or clinic to 
record medical information such as bed occupation ratio, diagnoses, medicines, etc.

When I thought of this project, I knew I had to do this. It is very applicable to the real world and is also very 
helpful in digitalizing important medical information and eliminating the risk of errors and losing information. 
This project is also very much aligned with my major *(Computer Science and Biology)*. I am glad I have this amazing
opportunity to apply computer science in the field of biology.
